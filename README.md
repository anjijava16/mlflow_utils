# Model API
You can save and load MLflow Models in multiple ways. First, MLflow includes integrations with several common libraries. For example, mlflow.sklearn contains save_model, log_model, and load_model functions for scikit-learn models. Second, you can use the mlflow.models.Model class to create and write models. This class has four key functions:

add_flavor to add a flavor to the model. Each flavor has a string name and a dictionary of key-value attributes, where the values can be any object that can be serialized to YAML.

1. save to save the model to a local directory.

2. log to log the model as an artifact in the current run using MLflow Tracking.

3. load to load a model from a local directory or from an artifact in a previous run.
